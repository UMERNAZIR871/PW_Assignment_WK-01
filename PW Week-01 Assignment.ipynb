    "Q1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "Python is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for Python’s popularity:\n",
    "Easy to Learn: Its clean and readable syntax makes it ideal for beginners.\n",
    "Versatile: Applicable in many domains such as web development, data science, AI, scripting, and automation.\n",
    "Large Community: A vast number of libraries, frameworks, tutorials, and community support are available.\n",
    "Cross-Platform: Python code can run on different operating systems without modification.\n",
    "High Demand: Its widespread use in the tech industry leads to strong job opportunities."

    "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "An interpreter in Python is a program that executes code line by line, translating high-level Python instructions into machine-level code at runtime. Unlike compiled languages, Python does not require a separate compilation step—the interpreter processes the code directly and immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "Interactive Development: You can test code snippets in real-time using tools like the Python shell or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "Faster Debugging: Errors can be detected and fixed quickly, as the code runs line by line.\n",
    "Platform Independence: The interpreter abstracts away platform-specific details, making Python programs portable across systems.\n",
    "Python’s interpreted nature is one of the key reasons it is so popular for rapid development, scripting, and learning programming."

    "\n",
    "They are used to define the logic, control flow, and structure of Python programs.\n",

    "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution based on specified conditions. They allow programs to make decisions, execute certain blocks of code only when a condition is met, and handle different scenarios dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Primary Purpose:\n",
    "To enable decision-making in a program by executing different code paths depending on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Common Conditional Statements in Python:\n",
    "if statement – Executes a block if the condition is True.\n",
    "if-else statement – Executes one block if the condition is True, another if it is False.\n",
    "if-elif-else chain – Checks multiple conditions in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why Conditional Statements Are Important:\n",
    "Introduce logic and intelligence into programs\n",
    "Allow programs to respond to input or data\n",
    "Make programs interactive and dynamic\n",
    "Essential for implementing loops, functions, and algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Conditional statements are fundamental to programming logic. They enable Python programs to behave differently under varying conditions, making the software functional, flexible, and intelligent."

    "Q12.  How does the elif statement work\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "The elif (short for “else if”) statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. It allows a program to test several expressions for truth value and execute a specific block of code for the first true condition encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Syntax:\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Executes if condition1 is True\n",

    "    # Executes if all previous conditions are False and condition3 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Executes if none of the above conditions are True\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "The program evaluates each condition in order.\n",
    "As soon as it finds a condition that is True, it executes that block and skips the rest.\n",
    "If none of the if or elif conditions are true, it executes the else block (if provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔒 Important Notes:\n",
    "elif is only evaluated if all previous if/elif conditions are False.\n",
    "You can have multiple elif statements, but only one else (which is optional).\n",
