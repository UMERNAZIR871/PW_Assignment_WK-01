    "Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean result (True or False). They operate on Boolean values and are primarily used in control flow (e.g., if, while) and expressions involving conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides three logical operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. and (Logical AND)\n",
    "    - Returns True if both conditions are True.\n",
    "    - Returns False if any condition is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  or (Logical OR)\n",
    "    - Returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
    "    - Returns False only if both conditions are False.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. not (Logical NOT)\n",
    "    - Reverses the Boolean value.\n",
    "    - not True becomes False, and not False becomes True.\n",

    "**Ans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution based on specified conditions. They allow programs to make decisions, execute certain blocks of code only when a condition is met, and handle different scenarios dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Primary Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable decision-making in a program by executing different code paths depending on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Conditional Statements in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- if statement – Executes a block if the condition is True.\n",
    "- if-else statement – Executes one block if the condition is True, another if it is False.\n",
    "- if-elif-else chain – Checks multiple conditions in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Conditional Statements Are Important:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce logic and intelligence into programs\n",
    "- Allow programs to respond to input or data\n",
    "- Make programs interactive and dynamic\n",
    "- Essential for implementing loops, functions, and algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**:  \n",
    "Conditional statements are fundamental to programming logic. They enable Python programs to behave differently under varying conditions, making the software functional, flexible, and intelligent."

    "**Ans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The elif (short for “else if”) statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. It allows a program to test several expressions for truth value and execute a specific block of code for the first true condition encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition1: \n",
    "    # Do this if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Do this if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # Do this if previous conditions are False AND condition3 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Do this if none of the above conditions are True\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:ddba5fde-0cef-4861-871c-0ff688a2132b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The program evaluates each condition in order.\n",
    "- As soon as it finds a condition that is True, it executes that block and skips the rest.\n",
    "- If none of the if or elif conditions are true, it executes the else block (if provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔒 Important Notes:**\n",
    "- elif is only evaluated if all previous if/elif conditions are False.\n",
    "- You can have multiple elif statements, but only one else (which is optional).\n",
    "- Improves readability compared to nested if statements."

    "Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "In Python, both for and while loops are used for iteration,but they differ in usage, structure, and control logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "for loop:\n",
    "The for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
    "It is typically used when the number of iterations is known or predetermined.\n",
    "Use case: The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    # code block\n",
    "\n",
    "while loop:\n",
    "The while loop runs as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "It is typically used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n",
    "Use case: The while loop is used when you do not know the number of iterations in advance but want to repeat until a certain condition is met\n",
